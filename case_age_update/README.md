# Case Age Update Extension

## Overview

The Case Age Update extension for CiviCRM provides a visual indicator of the age of open cases within your system. By displaying the age of each case in days, this extension helps organizations prioritize their workload and manage cases more effectively. Cases are color-coded based on their age, allowing for quick identification of cases that require urgent attention.

## Features

* Case Age Display: Automatically calculates and displays the age of open cases within CiviCRM.

* Color-Coded Indicators: Uses color coding to differentiate the urgency of cases: * Green: Case has been open for less than a day. * Yellow: Case has been open for more than one day. * Red: Case has been open for more than two days.

* Customizable Configuration: Allows administrators to adjust the color thresholds and display options according to their organization’s needs.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Before configuring the Case Age Update extension, ensure you have the following:

* CiviCRM: A running instance of CiviCRM on your CMS (e.g., WordPress, Drupal, Joomla).

* Admin Access: Administrative privileges to configure extensions within CiviCRM.

### Installation Steps

* Enable the Extension: * Log in to your CiviCRM instance as an administrator. * Navigate to Administer > System Settings > Extensions. * Locate the Case Age Update extension and click "Install".

* Configure the Extension: * After installation, go to Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Case Age Update. * Define the thresholds for case aging: * Set the time limits for when a case should turn yellow or red based on its age. * Adjust any additional configuration settings to fit your organization's workflow.

## Usage Guide

Once the Case Age Update extension is installed and configured:

* Monitor Case Ages: * Navigate to your case management screen in CiviCRM. * The age of each open case will be displayed next to the case, color-coded according to the configured thresholds.

* Prioritize Workload: * Use the color-coded case ages to quickly identify and prioritize cases that have been open the longest. * Address red-coded cases as a priority, followed by yellow, and then green.

* Adjust Configuration: * If needed, revisit the configuration settings to adjust the color thresholds or other display options.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

* Case Age Not Displaying Correctly: Ensure that the extension is enabled and properly configured. Double-check the color thresholds and ensure that your CiviCRM installation is up to date.

* Configuration Settings Not Applying: Clear the CiviCRM cache after making changes to the extension’s settings to ensure that updates are reflected.
